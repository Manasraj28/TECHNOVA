**OVERVIEW OF THIS PROJECT**: <br>
Managing money is tough when you dont know where it's going. So our project Smart Expense AI helps users to track their spending, predicts next month's expenses, and warns them before they overspend,especially on things like food and shopping. <br>
OUR GOAL? Help people make smarter financial decisions without needing to be finance experts. 
<br>

3) Show warning when spending on food/shopping crosses ₹5000<br>
4) Get simple, helpful suggestions to improve savings<br>
5) All currencies are included, facilate global search 

**How It Works** <br>
1. User enters daily expenses  <br>
2. AI analyzes the data in real time  <br>
3. ML logic classifies categories like food, travel, etc.  <br>
4. If predicted spending > ₹5000 → show a  warning  <br>
5. App suggests actions like reducing takeout or shopping less <br>
