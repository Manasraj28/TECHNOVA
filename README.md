Managing money is tough when you dont know where it's going. So our project Smart Expense AI helps users to track their spending, predicts next month's expenses, and warns them before they overspend,especially on things like food and shopping.
OUR GOAL? Help people make smarter financial decisions without needing to be finance experts. 
<br>

2) Predict next month’s spending using past data<br>

4) Get simple, helpful suggestions to improve savings<br>

**How It Works** <br>
1. User enters daily expenses  <br>
